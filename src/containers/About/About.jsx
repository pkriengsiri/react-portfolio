          Welcome to my portfolio! I am an aspiring software developer based in
          Atlanta, GA and currently enrolled in the Georgia Tech Coding Boot
          Camp. For most of the past 15 years, I have been performing work as an
          occupational safety and risk management consultant both in the public
          and private sectors—most recently with my company Mantrada LLC. A
          slowdown in work due to the pandemic provided me with an opportunity
          to pursue a long-time dream.

          brief-case style computer, complete with a 12 MHz processor, 640 KB of
          ram and a built-in 10” gas-plasma display. Here is where I learned the
          wonders of navigating MS-DOS and playing simple text-based games
          written in BASIC. My childhood was filled with weekends with my
          brother and uncle perusing junk computer stores looking for parts for
          our latest Frankenstein PC build.
